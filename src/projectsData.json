The player finds himself deep down a subway \nfrom which he has to escape to the top while going through rooms of enemies. \nThose rooms have the particularity to have random variations of the ambient \ntemperature. It is possible to switch at any time between two characters who \nboth have their own strengths and weaknesses."
